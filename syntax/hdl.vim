" The `.hdl` extension is reserved for the `vhdl` filetype, and, by the time
" this plugin is sourced, Vim has already loaded the `vhdl` ftplugin files,
" which contain some undesired settings. The fullproof way to ignore them is to
" prevent Vim from ever setting the `vhdl` filetype, which can only be done by
" having the user specify the following:
"
"   au BufNewFile,BufRead *.hdl setfiletype hdl
"
" in their vimrc, which is messy. Best to let the plugin do the work just by
" explicitly overriding the settings that we don't want, like the following.
